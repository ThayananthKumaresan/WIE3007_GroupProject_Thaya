# Hotel Booking Data Analysis Case Study

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a hotel booking dataset, aiming to extract valuable insights into booking patterns, customer preferences, and factors influencing cancellations. The project follows the SAS SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess) methodology to explore, preprocess, model, and assess the data.

## Objectives

1. **Explore Booking Dynamics:** Understand distinct patterns in booking behavior and identify influential factors for successful reservations.
2. **Predictive Modeling:** Develop predictive models to forecast the likelihood of booking cancellations, enabling proactive measures.
3. **Customer Engagement Optimization:** Uncover opportunities to enhance customer engagement through personalized experiences based on historical booking behavior.

## Tools Used

- **SAS Enterprise Miner:** Utilized for to apply SEMMA methodlogy.
- **Talend Open Studio for Data Integration:** Used for extracting and loading data, as well as performing essential data preprocessing tasks which is concatenate three sperated date columns into one.
- **Talend Data Preparation:** Applied for feature engineering, including the creation of new features like `length_of_stay` and `total_guests`, as well as encoding categorical variables and other cleaning tasks as well
- **Knime:** Utilized to DBSCAN clustering

## Project Structure

The project is structured in the following stages:

### 1. Sample

- **Data Collection:** Kaggle-provided hotel booking dataset used as the basis for analysis.

### 2. Explore

- **Data Analysis:** Sequence analysis and DBSCAN clustering performed to uncover insights into booking patterns.
- **Variable Exploration:** Identification of relevant variables and their impact on the prediction problem.

### 3. Modify

- **Data Cleaning:** Tasks such as removing unwanted variables, encoding categorical variables, and imputing missing values.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features (`length_of_stay` and `total_guests`) to support downstream modeling.

### 4. Model

- **Decision Tree:** Employed for predictive modeling with a focus on interpretability.
- **Gradient Boosting:** Applied for comparison with Decision Tree and understanding model variations.
- **Ensemble Model:** Combining models for enhanced predictive performance.

### 5. Assess

- **Model Comparison:** Leveraged to evaluate and select the final model based on benchmarking criteria.

### 6. Address Overfitting & Class Imbalance

- **Oversampling:** Implemented to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance issues identified in the modeling stage.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides actionable insights for the hospitality industry, emphasizing booking patterns, customer preferences, and strategies to minimize cancellations. The predictive models developed enhance the ability to forecast booking outcomes and implement preventive measures.

## Recommendations and Future Work

- **Dynamic Pricing Strategies:** Further explore dynamic pricing based on historical booking patterns.
- **Personalization in Marketing:** Investigate avenues for more personalized marketing campaigns.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Implement systems for real-time monitoring to identify and prevent potential cancellations promptly.

## Acknowledgment

We express gratitude to Kaggle for providing the dataset and fostering a collaborative environment for data science enthusiasts.
